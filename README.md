In the WoW Vanilla 1.12 client, the Target of Target frame is laggy because it updates every frame. This addon uses SuperWoW's API to only update it when it actually requires an update.

### Required Client Mods
- [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/)

### Incompatible Addons
- Anything that overhauls your UI, such as pfUI or Dragonflight UI. You are not affected by this issue when using those addons.

### PerfBoost Compatibility
- If you are using the PerfBoost client mod, you must disable `Filter GUID Events` in order for this addon to function.
